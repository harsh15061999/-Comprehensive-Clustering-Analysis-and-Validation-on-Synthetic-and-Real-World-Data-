# -Comprehensive-Clustering-Analysis-and-Validation-on-Synthetic-and-Real-World-Data-

## Project Overview
This project focuses on implementing and evaluating various clustering methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets. The objective is to assess the performance of clustering algorithms using both external and internal validation techniques. The project includes two main tasks: clustering on synthetic datasets and clustering on a world indicators dataset to group similar countries.

## Task 1: Clustering on Synthetic Datasets
For each dataset provided (Data1.csv, Data2.csv, Data3.csv, Data4.csv, Data5.csv, Data6.csv, Data7.csv, Data8.csv), the following steps were performed:
1. **Clustering Methods**: Applied K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to generate clusters.
2. **External Validation**: Evaluated the performance of the clustering algorithms using external validation metrics.
3. **Visualization**: Created 2D or 3D plots of the data points, coloring them according to the original class and the clusters allocated by the algorithms.

## Task 2: Clustering on World Indicators Dataset
The world indicators dataset compares different countries based on selected attributes. The following steps were performed:
1. **Clustering Methods**: Applied K-means and hierarchical clustering methods to group similar countries together.
2. **Internal Validation**: Used internal validation metrics to report the cluster quality.
3. **Best Clustering Solution**: Reported the best clustering solution, providing a detailed list of all the groups and the countries included within the groups.
4. **Visualization**: Generated three scatter plots (e.g., Life Expectancy vs GDP, Infant Mortality vs GDP) and colored the data points according to the groups.

## Results
- Provided comprehensive visual and statistical evaluations of clustering performance on synthetic datasets.
- Identified and reported meaningful clusters in the world indicators dataset, providing insights into the similarities between different countries based on selected attributes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib/Seaborn
- Pandas
- NumPy

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of clustering algorithms and validation techniques on diverse datasets, providing valuable insights through effective data visualization and analysis.
